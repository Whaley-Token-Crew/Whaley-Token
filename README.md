## What is $WHALY?

$WHALY is a community-driven memecoin built on the Stacks blockchain. 

It's a digital asset that is powered by a dedicated and passionate community. Our mission is to bring the world of blockchain technology closer to the people and to demonstrate what can be achieved through the power of decentralization. 

We want to foster the development of dApps and DeFi protocols built on Stacks, and to create a vibrant and fun ecosystem. We believe in the power of collaboration and are committed to creating a welcoming and collaborative environment for all. 

We invite everyone to join us and help grow the Whaley community!

The Whaley community is getting rich, fast - "We're not just hodling, we're Whaley-ing!"
